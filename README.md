<h1> Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This Python script is designed to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset containing customer information, including various features such as account length, area code, international plan, voice mail plan, and more. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) and take proactive measures to retain them.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2> 
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:
1. bash
2. Copy code
3. pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
The dataset has been stored in a folder named "Data" within the project directory.
Update the data_folder and data_file variables to specify the path to your data file.

<h2>Running the Code:</h2>

Open the Python script (churn_project.py) in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Run the script to execute the following steps:
1. Ensure that your working directory folder is at Appfile folder
2. In the directoru, run _python churnproject.py_
