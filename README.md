**Telecom Customer Churn Prediction**
**_Overview_**
This Python script is designed to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset containing customer information, including various features such as account length, area code, international plan, voice mail plan, and more. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) and take proactive measures to retain them.

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
**_Data Preparation:_**

The dataset has been stored in a folder named "Data" within the project directory.
Update the data_folder and data_file variables to specify the path to your data file.
Running the Code:

Open the Python script (churn_project.py) in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
